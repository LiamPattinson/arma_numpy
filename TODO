- Allow upcasting vec->matrix->cube, and also downcasting if dimensions agree (i.e. (1,3) matrix, or (1,4,1) cube, etc.)
- Return by const reference/pointer returns by value.
- Return by non-const pointer illegal, but non-const reference should have Numpy use the data but not steal a reference.
- Test wrapping of a class (implement a simple 1D grid of 3-vecs?)
- Return by unique_ptr or shared_ptr? Former should steal a reference, latter will be tricky to work with.
- More compatibility tests (i.e. actually check that Arma uses int64_t by default).
